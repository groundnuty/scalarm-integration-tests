Java 1.7 and maven required.

Possible arguments are: GWDG, FLEXIANT or AGH

To run using maven:
mvn clean compile exec:java  -Dexec.args="GWDG"

To build standalone executable jar:
mvn clean compile assembly:single
jar then can be found in target/ folder.

And can be invoked like:
java -jar scalarmintegrationtests-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar "GWDG"

Because of slow response of GWDG execution of jar can take a while (maximum time encountered was about 3 mins)

On successful execution jar returns with exit code 0, or failure it returns with 1 (accompanied by some debugging info).
